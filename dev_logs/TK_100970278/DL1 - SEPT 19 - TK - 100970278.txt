We have decided that meetings will be help on Mondays, around noon, in HP 3341.

We have had our first few meetings, and have decided our app goal: to create an app that helps
university students find their way through large confusing campus buildings.

Below is some functionality we want our app to have:

	-Navigate to specific classes within a building
	-Class reminders (notifications)
	-Outdoor navigation between buildings? (If time only)
	-Being able to input a students schedule
