In the coming week, we have our oral exam and D3 to hand in. For this reason, I've been spending
a lot of time working on diagrams and written documents.

I will upload the diagrams.

For the 80% functionality by the oral interview, all we need to do is finish the start location
implementation for mapping (Alex) and add a few more floors of Herzberg into our XML data (Me).

Oral discussion preperation together later this week in HP3341, prior to discussion.
