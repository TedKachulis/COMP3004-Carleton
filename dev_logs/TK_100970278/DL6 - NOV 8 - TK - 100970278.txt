This week we implemented our mapping system (not the algorithm, but the nodes). We have figured out
a method of mapping nodes using coordinates on the users screen image of the map. We will store these
nodes with each having a name, position on the screen, and a list of other nodes it is connected to.

The connected nodes will form a mapped network for our algorithm to work with, finding efficient path
routes for a user. We will be storing these nodes in an XML file, as it takes little to no storage while
still being quickly searchable.

We mostly worked on filling in XML files with data and figuring out the formatting of nodes/how the nodes 
will be displaying on the screen as a line to follow.
