This week we met on Monday as usual.

We now have basic mapping algorithm done thanks to Alex. Parth has started 
creating vector/png files for our map display.

Mike and I are working on the class notification and scheduling system. At
discussed intervals, the four of us will meet to merge our progresses together
to our master application.

At this point, we have a good amount of functionality and are confident that
we can achieve what we want to in regards to functionality with this app.
