This week has had a lot of progress so far. We commit to meeting up a few times over the reading week.

At todays get together, we pushed a lot of updates to our repository and cleaned up most of the UI. Our
mapping is getting figured out with pretty good progress. We will be using scaled images and a coordinate
system of nodes.

We will be using vector recreations of the blueprints found at elevators and emergency exits of the campus
buildings.

For testing purposes, we've been modelling the third floor of Herzberg.
