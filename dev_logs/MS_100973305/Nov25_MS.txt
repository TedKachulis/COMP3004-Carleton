Michael Stupich Dev Log -- November 25, 2016

Collaborated on Deliverable 3

Coding: 
	Worked on reading and writing to xml for mySchedule page
	Still having issues with locating the file when using openFileInput().
	Once that is solved however, nearly everything will be done, as the coding around that is almost all done and just needs to be slightly remapped.
