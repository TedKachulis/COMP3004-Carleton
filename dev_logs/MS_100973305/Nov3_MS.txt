Discussed some layout ideas with Ted regarding My Schedule page

Coding:
	Read the preferences that were saved to xml file
	Created notification function to alert user
		--> Used for notifications before class
		--> Created a function that will take a time provided by the user when they enter their class info, and send them a notification
