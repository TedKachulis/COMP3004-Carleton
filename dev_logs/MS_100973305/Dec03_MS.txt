Michael Stupich Dev Log -- December 3, 2016

Discussed final UI with the group. Discussed with Alex how we would like to implement the notification start position.
We decided on main activity with user able to choose their own start room. 

Coding:
	Fixed the notification system to alert user at the correct time
	Remove class button on ViewClassActivity now properly removes the class
	Made some slight changes to the UI
