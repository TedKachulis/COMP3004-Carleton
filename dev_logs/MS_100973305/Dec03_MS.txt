Michael Stupich Dev Log -- December 3, 2016

Discussed final UI with the group. Discussed with Alex how we would like to implement the notification start position.
We decided on main activity with user able to choose their own start room. 

Coding:
	Fixed the notification system to alert user at the correct time
		->Passing the room string to the main activity to allow user to easily get to room from notification.
	Remove class button on ViewClassActivity now properly removes the class
		-> Added the name as an ID attribute, so I could locate the correct class in the xml, and remove
		   it, as using the position was giving issues.
	Made some slight changes to the UI
		->Changed some themes, Added the back arrow in the top left.
