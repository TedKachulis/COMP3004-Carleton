Discussed how information will be passed between the notifications and the program
	-> Pass end room to the program
		->How will start room be decided? (Currently undecided on this)

Coding:
	Set up notification to bring user to Map Activity with end Room.
	Worked on reading and writing to xml again.
		-> Have to figure out where the xml is stored in internal storage.
		-> Where to put the xml in Android Studio so that the phone is able to edit the file
