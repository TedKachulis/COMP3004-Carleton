Theodore Kachulis - 100970278 - OCT Week 2

This week we have finished pre implementation discussion, and are starting to get to
work on the code.

We are now messing around with early UI and implementation, as can be seen in the repo
recently/shortly. We are each cloning and starting to put in our ideas.

At tomorrows meeting, we will be discussing specific tasks for each member. Thus far,
we have decided that Alex will be handling most back end, and I will be handling most
UI and design implementation. Mike and Parth will be each partnering with Alex and I, 
to form teams of two. However, Mike and Parth will be responsible for planning how the
front end and back end will interact, since they have experience in both.

We will be starting to implement our visual map method tomorrow, using (hopefully) a tile
based system. Before we know for sure, we want to try a few things out.

This weeks goals include figuring out and implementing a mock version of our visual map,
and deciding on deadlines. We are all busy due to midterms etc right now, but we have plans
for a codeathon/hack meetup over reading week to make some solid progress.
