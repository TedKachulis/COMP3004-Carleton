Started work on XML files, discovered problems with pathfinding and map rendering.

Pathfinding:
  > few minor bugs got fixed (confused lists, problems with node storage)
  > changed design to store connections as Strings rather then nodes, allowing for quicker 
    parsing and less storage
   
Map rendering:
  > using png's instead of SVG's for simplicity's sake, they seem to fit the screen nicely
  > aesthetic changes made to the route (primarily line width)
