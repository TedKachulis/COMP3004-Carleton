Finished the project, including upgrades to map activity, exception handling (ommitted until now
in order to test our XML's integrity) and extensive testing

Map Activity:
  > Now takes start room and end room, paths between them
  > Now allows for more then 2 floors to be "relevant" for use of tunnels
  > Exception handling added to make sure user input is in the right format
  
Building:
  > Exception handling added to account for rooms not existing, keeps app from crashing and 
    returns users to the main activity
