Now that multiple floors worth of XMLs are complete, re-tested and made improvements to the
map activity and map nodes

Map Node
  > Now has some extra getters, primarily getFloor(), which parses it's id for the floor it's 
    located on
    
Map Activity
  > Now reads number of floors, and allocates space for all the floor maps, then reads those png's
    into memory
  > Now switches between relevant maps using touch input
  
XML
  > Buildings now indicate how many floors they have
  > Fixed broken connections which were causing crashes
